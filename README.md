# OpenFitness
Platform agnostic standard for managing and sharing fitness programs.


## Why the standard is necessary
Currently, fitness apps and platforms operate in a closed-wall system, restricting the sharing of workout programs between users. Establishing an open standard for fitness data sharing will significantly enhance the user experience by allowing seamless sharing of workout programs across different platforms.


## Who the standard will affect

### Fitness Platform Developers
Application developers will need to adopt and integrate the open standards format into their applications. By integrating the standards, developers can offer their users greater flexibility, ensuring continued use of their apps. This will also simplify the creation and sharing of fitness programs across different platforms.

### Trainers and workout professionals
Fitness blogs and trainers will find it easier to share workout programs with their clients. This will streamline the fitness program market, making it simpler for users to access and follow various training regimens.

### Users
Fitness app users will benefit greatly from this standard, as it will enable them to share and receive workout programs without being confined to a single application.

## How the standard was or will be developed
This standard will be a set of guidelines and data format specifications to be adopted by fitness platforms, ensuring compatibility and ease of use across various applications.
